##  Python

We recognize that this Python could be abstracted better.  Next steps, pass the functions as an argument, create additional modules.  Perhaps, even turn this into a flask page.  We're just super proud that we were able to generate 170 districts.

## kTs

Rosane, Jessica, and I worked through all possible district shapes.  The shapes in this pdf are the ones we reference in our methods.
